<div id="idTextPanel">
  <p>During my web development program, I had the opportunity to design and develop a website for a small local business. It actually has an interesting story to it. I have once heard the old saying of &quot;It is better to shoot for the stars and miss, than to aim for a pile of manure and hit&quot;. Well, I'm sure whatever philosopher who came up with that one would have got a good laugh if they heard that for my first actual website created, I did it for a septic pumpng company.</p>
  <p>I acted as the website designer, developer, and webmaster for Superior Septic Services, LLC. Based out of Arlington, WA, the company began to realize that they needed to establish a website as a way of attracting new customers as well as keeing touch with existing customers. The combination of not having enough cash flow for a paid professional developer and me needing practical real world turned out to be a very good combination. The first version of the website was up and running in early Feburary and has undergone some dramatic changes since. It started out as a static HTML site with a little bit of JavaScript to help with the menu. As I was able to progress in my development skills, I continued to add more features to the site. By the end of winter, the site's common features were dynamically loaded along with a PHP powered contact form. The site eventually became powered by a PHP/MySQL custom content management system. Having this site under my belt has also opened the door for me to do several other freelance projects.</p>
