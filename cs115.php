    <p>Coming to Edmonds, this is the first class in computer programming that I took.  When I took the class, it namely focused around building programs in regular Visual Basic, as opposed to focusing more on VB.Net as it does now.  Regardless, much of concepts were the same.  We spent a lot of time geting to know how to use Visual Studio as well as create, debug, and test programs.  Although I am a Mac person, I really did like Microsoft's Visual Studio in how it allowed for the UI to be developed quickly.</p>
    
  <p>I was a little apprehensive about taking Visual Basic because I actually took an eariler version of the class over 10 years prior and didn't do that well. I was glad to see that time can change things and while there were some parts I struggled with, I did quite well in the class. While I have not utilized Visual Basic since, I do credit the class with teaching me how to really think like a computer would in processing code. Though I am still admittingly not a huge fan of it, this class also made me learn the importance of documentation.</p>
  <p>Below are hyperlinks to zipped files of some of my projects. They include the necessary executable file to run, as well as all of my documentation. If you are interested, feel free to download them and take a look.</p>
