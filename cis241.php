  <p>Taken a year ago as of this writing,CIS 241 was the class that introduced, and reintroduced me to the world of HTML.</p>
  <p>I have taken a couple of classes in the past that taught me some HTML, and I learned some on my own as well. So taking this class was a good way to call out those dormant skills, as well as grow upon them. While HTML5 is the web standard that is slowly becomming the norm and superceding XHTML, it was all about XHTML when I was taking CIS 241. Goes to show how quickly things can change in a year.</p>
  <p>Because XHTML is a hybrid of HTML and XML standards, we learned how to form web pages in a way that would appease the XML side of things. That is, perfect. To prove that my XHTML was well formed, I ensured that every assignment that I produced was in full compliance with the<a href="htttp://www.w3c.org"> World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a> standards for XHTML 1.0 transitional. I and the rest of the class were only permitted to hand code our pages; no WYSISYG editors were allowed to be used (unless they had the ability to hand code them). The class was also expected to learn a wide variety of web development aspects that included but not limited to be able to perform content and technical analysis, implement application / site design, maintain web applications, use XHTML documents to develop effective websites, as well as understand and debug XHTML pages.</p>
  <p>Our class final was to create a &quot;personal professional&quot; site that showcased our XHTML proficiency.  Mine can be accessed by going here:</p>
  <p><a href="cis241/home.htm">My XHTML Final Project</a></p>
  <p>While there are features  and improvements I can make to improve the site's functionality and design, I decided to  leave it alone as a way of showing how my skills have progressed since this class.  Every page is in full compliance with the W3C's XHTML 1.0 Transitional standards.</p>
