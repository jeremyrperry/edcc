<div id="idTextPanel">
  <p>Hello, and welcome to my Web Application Development ATA portfolio.</p>
  <p>My name is Jeremy, and I am almost finished with the above mentioned program at Edmonds Community College. During my studies, I have learned a wide array of web development related skills and practices. This includes HTML, JavaScript, SQL, PHP, XML, Systems Analysis, Systems Design, general computer programming, and even some management classes as well. I have expanded beyond what is taught in the classroom by learning on my own how to use my web development skills to create mobile websites and applications, and have taught a one time lecture on how to get into developing for mobile. I am also currently learning how to design and development templates, modules, and add-on's for the three most popular open-source Content Management Systems out there: WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal.</p>
  <p>I enrolled in the program largely because of how dismal the job market was after getting my Bachelor's degree in English from Western Washington University. My reasons were two-fold; I already knew how to do a little bit of HTML, liked the thought of developing websites and web applications, and many of the writing-oriented jobs I was applying for wanted to see somebody with some form of web development skills. So I started up in Spring of 2010 and have been going strong ever since.</p>
