  <p>Even though knowing just HTML and JavaScript allows for some very impressive web pages to be built, knowledge of some form of server side language is necessary to make most websites be able to reach their full potential. CIS 243 was an introduction to the use of PHP, one of the most commonly used object oriented languages for server side programming.</p>
  <p>PHP is by far from the only only server-side language in existence. Other server side languages in use include ASP.NET, classic ASP, Perl, Python, Ruby on Rails, Cold Fusion, Java Server Pages, etc. While all of these languages are extremely useful and have their purpose, PHP is used in the EdCC pipeline because its open source nature allows both students and the school to keep their costs down, its relative ease of learning, widespread use, and how dynamic and robust PHP is. This porfolio was written in PHP because PHP allows for using several seperate scripts to be combined to make a web page (i.e. allows for a common header and footer) and does it much more efficiently than JavaScript can. One of the primary reasons PHP (or any server-side scripting language) is used is becuse it allows for a web page to interact with a database. PHP in conjunction with MySQL, a popular open source database, is the programming and database architecture that is used to power three of the worlds most popular open source content management systems: WordPress, Joomla!, and Drupal.</p>
  <p>CIS 243 was the class that not only taught me the importance of server-side programming, but how to bring my previously learned knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and SQL together to build a top knotch website. Forms became much easier to process since the results could be e mailed (without having to rely on the client) and/or sent to a database. The concept of permitting an average end user modify a web page became possible. PHP could dynamically read a directory and automatically populate a list of contents on a web page. The list of server side scripting advantages goes on and on.</p>
  <p>Like many other freelance developers, PHP is now my de facto web programming language of choice and I only do not suggest its use when the needs and requirements of a website dictate othewise.</p>
  <p>My first class PHP project was to create a form that gathers a user's input to render a result page that was able to change font positioning, coloring, etc. It can be accessed here:</p>

  <p>My second class PHP project was to also create a form that generated a random number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess the right number. The game can be accessed here:</p>

  <p>My third and final class PHP project was to develop a custom content management system that utilized all of my previously learned web development skills to allow for the customer to be able to edit much of the content on their actual website. This project was extremely challenging, but taught me a lot about what it takes to develop a workable server-side solution for a client. The link for the portal to access the site is below, but for security and potential copyright reasons (the project is based off an actual web site), access is restricted to only authorized users. Please contact me if you wish to have access and/or want me to give you a demonstration.</p>

  <p>Please also be aware that all of my current professional projects all employ a custom CMS based off of PHP and MySQL. They are listed on my main porfolio for my freelance business. Feel free to check them out.</p>
