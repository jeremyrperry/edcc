<p>Having time to reflect upon taking CIS 241 this quarter, there are a few things that have come to mind.</p>

<p>First off, I learned that developing and maintaining a web site is a lot of work.  I have personally spent hours developing this site, and yet it only has some of the most basic elements to make it functional.  
I know that if I am to continue in the field of web development, I have my work cut out for me.  Fortunately, I enjoy working with the web and technology in general, so I'm looking forward to it.</p>

<p>I also had a couple ah-ha moments this quarter.  The first was when, as a Mac user, I noticed that all of the instructions for FTPing and text editor options were listed for PC users.  I knew that I had to do something about this.
Instead of twiddling my thumbs, I hit the ground running and was able to find a very useable freeware text editor and several different options.  Because I knew I'm not completely alone in being a Mac user, I posted the options in the discussion board.
My instructor liked them enough to where she wanted to post them as permanent instructions, and I let her.  Long story short, I learned that I will often have to think above and beyond the simple instructions to figure out what will work for me.  When I did, I got a lot of satisfaction knowing that what I found will continue to help others.</p>

<p>My second ah-ha moment as during the CSS-table debate discussion.  I learned from it that while XHTML does have a basic science to it, it also has an art form as well.  I came to the conclusion that in order to be a good web developer, I need to know as much as I can about the different ways to create a web page.
That will come in handy for when I actually take my skills to the real world and can advise a client or development team on which approach will work best for them.</p>

<p>Overall, CIS 241 has been a great class to take and I look forward to developing my skills as a web developer even more.</p>
