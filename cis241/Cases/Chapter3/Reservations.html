<h1>Reservations</h1>
<h2>Sunshine Boat Rentals and Charters</h2>
<p>Thank you for your interest in renting or chartering from us.  We look forward to doing business with you.  
To make your reservation inquiry, you may stop in or call us during our business hours, or e-mail us.  
If you e-mail, we will need the following information:</p>

<p>-  Name<br />
-  Address<br />
-  Daytime phone number<br />
-  Number in party<br />
-  Boat and dates desired<br />
-  Alternate boats and dates (optional)<br />
-  Rental or charter<br />
-  Preferred method of contact</p>

<p>Our e-mail address for rental inquiries is <a href="mailto.info@sunshineboats.com">info@sunshineboats.com</a>.  For over-the-phone or walk-in inquiries, please call us at 360-987-6543 or visit us during business hours.  Our location and business hours are listed 
on the <a href="BoatRentals.html">main page</a>.</p>

<p>We will respond to all e mail inquires within two business days in regards to availability.  We will give you a courtesy 
hold for an additional two business days from the day of our response.  To confirm your reservation, you may either stop by 
or call during business hours.  Unfortunately, we are currently not able to process deposits over the internet (please do not e mail us any credit card information).  At the time of your confirmation, we will require a major credit card to hold your reservation.  Your card will not be charged, but we will place a hold for the full reservation amount plus applicable deposits and fees.  
We do not recommend the use of debit cards for holding the reservation because the process will freeze the funds in your account.
Final payment can also be made by cash, check, debit card, or Paypal.  For final payments made by check, we will release the hold on your credit card once the check clears the bank.
</p>

<p><u>Additional information for all customers:</u></p>

<p>Reservations can be made up to 365 days in advance.  Reservations must be confirmed at least 24 hours in advance for rentals and 48 hours for charters.  To ensure you get the boat and days you desire, we recommend that reservations be made at least 30 days in advance during 
the peak season and two weeks in advance during the off season.  For major peak season holidays, we strongly recommend reservations be made at least 90 days in advance.  We reserve the right to modify or cancel reservations due to mechanical issues or inclimate weather 
without prior notice.  All cancellations due to mechanical issues or weather will be given a full refund.  If you wish to modify or cancel your reservation, please give us at least 24 hours notice for rentals or 48 hours notice for charters. For cancellations made within the time frame, we will refund your deposit less a $50 administrative fee.  All cancellations made with less notice or no-shows
will be charged a full day's rate.</p>

<p><u>Additional information for charter customers:</u></p>

<p>Please arrive at least 15 minutes prior to check-in time.  Our charter staff consists of highly trained professionals who meet or exceed all Coast Guard licensing requirements.  
They will be more than happy to skipper the boat to anywhere within the alloted reservation time and the boat's capabilities.  All multi-day charters will return to port by 10 AM of the last day on the reservation.
Please be aware that you are responsible for bringing your own food and beverages, and will be financially responsibie for any negligent damage.  
While you are responsible for fuel costs, the charter staff will take care of refueling upon return to port.</p>

<p><u>Additional information for rental customers:</u></p>

<p>Please arrive at least 15 minutes prior to your check-in time.  At the time of check in, you must provide the following if you haven't already done so:</p>

<p>-  Proof of completion of a boater's safety course for at least one person in the party (Coast Guard licensing may be required in some circumstances).<br />
-  Proof of liability insurance or purchase our rental insurance (we reserve the right to ask for a deposit equal to the deductable).</p>

<p>Customers who fail to satisfy any of the aforementioned requirements will be treated as a no-show.  All multi-day rentals must return to port by 10 AM on the last day for check-out inspection.  
Rental customers must return the boat clean, holding tank pumped out, and fuel tank full in order to have the readiness deposit fully refunded.</p>

<p>We look forward to seeing you soon!</p>
