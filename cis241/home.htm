<!-- I tried putting the div element after the <td> declaration, but it would only format the color around the text and pictures and not the whole <td> element.
When I put it before the <td> declaration, it won't pass W3c standards.  I got it to work by putting it as an inline style element, but would like to find a way to use my CSS sheet.  Please help if you can.-->

	<h3>Welcome to my CIS 241 website!</h3>
	<p>I created this website as a demonstration of the skills I learned in CIS 241, which is an introduction to XHTML.  Everything on this site has been created from scratch using XHTML standards as determined by the <a href="http://www.w3c.org">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>.
	The image to the left contains links to various pages within my website.  Below is a brief description of each:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>My Resume</b> - An up-to-date XHTML version of my resume.  It is in a plain-text format for ease of scanning.</li>
			<li><b>My Guestbook</b> - A form I created for people who have visited my site to leave me a comment.  You can use it to leave me feedback on my site.</li>
			<li><b>My Interests</b> - A little bit about me and what I like to do when I'm not busy with school.</li>
			<li><b>Reflections</b> - Here you can see some of my thoughts about taking CIS 241.</li>
			<li><b>My "Cases" Page</b> - This is a springboard page to some of the XHTML skillsets that I learned this term.</li>
		</ul>
	<h3>About Me</h3>
	<img src="Graphics/JeremyParis.jpg" alt="A picture of me in front of the Eiffel Tower" />
	<p>My name is Jeremy Perry. I am currently working on a Web Application Developer degree at <a href="http://www.edcc.edu">Edmonds Community College</a>, hence why I am taking this class. I already have a Bachelor's degree in English (Creative Writing Emphasis) with a minor in Journalism from <a href="http://www.wwu.edu">Western Washington University</a>, but since the economy is tough, I decided to keep doing some form of education. 
	Since the internet and computers in general have always been a passion of mine, I decided to go the web development route.  I am expecting to be finished with the program at the end of Summer quarter of 2011.</p>
	
	<p>One of the things I like to do is travelling.  In fact, since this class and the other class I took during Summer 2010 were online, I was able to travel for a little over a month through Europe for the first time.  Here are the places I visited during my trip:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Ireland - Dublin and Galway</li>
			<li>Spain - Barcelona</li>
			<li>France - Paris</li>
			<li>Germany - Hamburg</li>
			<li>The Netherlands - Amsterdam</li>
			<li>United Kingdom - London</li>
		</ul>
	<p>The picture above was an interesting shot of me trying not to be hit by taffic on the Pont d'lena bridge to get a night picture with the Eiffel Tower in the background.</p>
	<p>While they technically don't count as places visited, I had brief layovers in Frankfort, Germany and Zurich, Switzerland.  Even though I had the time of my life, my grades didn't suffer one bit as I earned A's in both of my classes.  I thoroughly celebrated that accomplishment in Amsterdam ;)   How's that for studying abroad?</p>
	
	<p>Travelling aside, I also like to fish, hunt, ski, ride bicycles, work out, sail and a whole multitude of other outdoor activities.  I am currently 29 years old and a Navy veteran (I visited a lot of Asia during my service).  I love good rock n' roll music, though I'm not opposed to hearing other music.  Maybe one day I might find out the meaning of life and the love of my life, 
	but until then I will at least live life up as much as I can.</p>
	
	<p>If you want to know more about me, please feel free to friend me on Facebook (link is below).</p>
	
	<p>Have fun exploring this part of my site!</p>
